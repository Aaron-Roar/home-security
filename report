    Concept Designs
        CoOperative Scheduler
            Problems
            Research
                Better with low level(Smart Jobs)(Trustable)(Faster no unoptimized context switching)
            Why decided to abort

        Preemptive Scheduler
            Problems
            Research
                Allow secure systems safe of malice jobs
                Important jobs always can come first

            Solutions to problems
            Why better then CoOperative(Because instructions are dynamic at runtime casuin insecurities)(Readin from sensors can be underterministic, making smart jobs impossible)


    Detailed Analysis
        Tasks
            Smart Jobs (Can spawn jobs or delete themselves or other jobs)
            Required information (periodic, resources, deadline, ect)
            Instructions(dynamic at runtim)

        Scheduler
            Dynamic algorithems at runtime
            Job que for potential over network jobs

        Interupts
            Hard deadline supprort
            Timer interupts

        Scheduling Algorithems
            EDf
            Is adaptable
            Scheduler independednt of algorithem

        Flight Algorithems
            Manage oriantation
            Manage Altitude
            Autonomous Landing


Potential Applications
    Research
        Test different scheduling algorithms at runtime for an application
        
    Industry
        Swarm Robotics
            Search and Rescue

Major Problems Faced
    Small group size(How 1 person can take on a big task)(Abstractions, scheduling, and organiation, scope control)
    Short time(Prioritization, Scheduler comes first)(Build API's first so virtualization can be done for testing or for delaying integration of a component)
    MultiDisciplinary(Spoke with many experts to get advice)(Some advice hurts, a plan you had exploded in front of you)(Not all information can be found in one spot)
    Operating system or not
